# Data-Science-Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed as part of course work during masters, self learning and leatning tutorials. Mos of them are presented in thr form of Jupyter notebook.

## Contents
- ### Machine learning micro projects

     - [KNN algorithm](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/Knn%20Algorithm.ipynb): This project involves building a KNN algorithm on the iris dataset in order to predict the species when sepal length, sepal width, petal width and petal length provided.
     - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/Linear%20regression.ipynb): This project involves building linear regression model on the bikeshare data which has been obtained from kaggle website. A linear regression model was built to predict count variable(number of total rentals) and its accuracy was calculated. Data visualization, exploratory data analysis has been performed.
     - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/Logistic%20regression.ipynb): This project involves building logistic regression model on the adult_sal data which has been obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I attempted to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making <=50k or >50k per year using logistic regression model and model's accuracy, precision, recall was calculated. Data visualization, data manipulation has been performed.
