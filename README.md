# Data-Science-Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed as part of course work during masters and self learning. Most of them are presented in the form of Jupyter notebook.

## Contents
- ### Machine learning micro projects

     - [Iris data-KNN Algorithm](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/Iris%20data-Knn%20Algorithm.ipynb): This project involves building a KNN algorithm on the iris dataset in order to predict the species when sepal length, sepal width, petal width and petal length provided.
     - [Bikeshare data-Linear regression](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/Bikeshare%20data-Linear%20regression.ipynb): This project involves building linear regression model on the bikeshare data which has been obtained from kaggle website. A linear regression model was built to predict count variable(number of total rentals) and its accuracy was calculated. Data visualization, exploratory data analysis has been performed.
     - [Adult salary data-Logistic regression](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/adult%20salary%20data-Logistic%20regression.ipynb): This project involves building logistic regression model on the adult_sal data which has been obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I attempted to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making <=50k or >50k per year using logistic regression model and model's accuracy, precision, recall was calculated. Data visualization, data manipulation has been performed.
     - [Loan data-Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/Loan%20data-Support%20Vector%20Machine.ipynb): This project involved exploratory analysis and data visulaization of loan data which was obtained from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Investor would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. A SVM model is developed that will help in predicting not.fully.paid variable.
     - [College data-Tree models](https://github.com/roshinireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20micro%20projects/College%20data-Tree%20models.ipynb):This project involved exploring the use of tree methods to classify schools as Private or Public based off their features. Data has been obtained from the ISLR Library.
